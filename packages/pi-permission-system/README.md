Permission enforcement extension for the [Pi](https://pi.mariozechner.at/) coding agent that provides centralized, deterministic permission gates over tool, bash, MCP, skill, and special operations.

> **Fork notice:** This package is a full fork of [MasuRii/pi-permission-system](https://github.com/MasuRii/pi-permission-system), published to npm as `@gotgenes/pi-permission-system`.
> It has diverged substantially from upstream in config format, internal architecture, and permission model.

## What It Does

- **Hides disallowed tools** before the agent starts — no wasted turns probing for blocked tools
- **Enforces allow / ask / deny** at tool-call time with UI confirmation dialogs
- **Controls bash commands** with wildcard pattern matching (`git *: ask`, `rm -rf *: deny`)
- **Gates MCP and skill access** at server, tool, and skill-name granularity
- **Protects sensitive file patterns** — cross-cutting `path` rules deny `.env`, `~/.ssh/*`, etc. across all tools and bash at once, matching both the path as referenced and its symlink-resolved form so a deny cannot be evaded through a symlink alias
- **Guards external paths** — prompts before file tools or bash commands reach outside `cwd`
- **Fails closed** — an internal gate error blocks the tool (with a `gate_error` review-log entry), and an unparseable bash command — or an indirection wrapper that hides the gated command (`bash -c`/`eval`, `sudo`, `env`, `xargs`, `find -exec`, …) — prompts (`ask`) rather than passing silently
- **Forwards prompts from subagents** — `ask` policies work even in non-UI execution contexts
- **Broadcasts UI prompt events** — `permissions:ui_prompt` fires only when the permission system is about to invoke the active user-facing permission UI
- **Explains ask-state requests with an optional LLM** — the existing permission page can show a concise intent classification, concrete hazards, and a low/medium/high/critical risk rating using a separately configured Pi model; the assessment is advisory and never changes policy
- **Native [`@gotgenes/pi-subagents`](https://github.com/gotgenes/pi-subagents) integration** — in-process child sessions register with the permission system automatically, enabling per-agent policy enforcement and `ask`-state forwarding to the parent UI without configuration

## Install

```bash
pi install npm:@gotgenes/pi-permission-system
```

## Quick Start

1. Create the global config file at `~/.pi/agent/extensions/pi-permission-system/config.json`:

    ```jsonc
    {
      "permission": {
        "*": "allow",
        "path": {
          "*": "allow",
          "*.env": "deny",
          "*.env.*": "deny",
          "*.env.example": "allow"
        },
        "bash": {
          "*": "ask",
          "rm -rf *": "deny",
          "sudo *": "ask"
        },
        "external_directory": "ask"
      }
    }
    ```

2. Start Pi — the extension automatically loads and enforces your policy.

All permissions use one of three states:

| State   | Behavior                                 |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `allow` | Permits the action silently              |
| `deny`  | Blocks the action with an error message  |
| `ask`   | Prompts the user for confirmation via UI |

When the dialog prompts, you can approve once or approve a pattern for the rest of the session.
In an interactive TUI session the prompt is an inline keybind dialog — `y` approve, `s` approve for this session, `n` deny, `r` deny with a reason — where each hotkey arms and a second press confirms (configurable via `doublePressToConfirm`).
See [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md#inline-permission-dialog-tui) for the hotkeys and [docs/session-approvals.md](docs/session-approvals.md) for session-scoped rules and pattern suggestions.

The analysis appears inside the same permission request page before the decision options.
It is advisory only: model failure, timeout, or malformed output falls back to the normal permission page and never auto-approves a request.
Configure it with `commandAnalysis` (disabled by default):

```jsonc
{
  "commandAnalysis": {
    "enabled": true,
    "provider": "sub2api",
    "model": "grok-4.5",
    "timeoutMs": 30000,
    "maxCommandLength": 4000
  }
}
```

Intent categories are: read/query, file creation, file modification, file deletion, command execution, dependency installation, network access, version control, process/service, permission/identity, system configuration, data transfer, compound operation, and unknown.
Risk levels are low, medium, high, and critical.

The `path` surface is a cross-cutting gate that applies to **all** file access — Pi tools, bash commands, MCP calls, and extension tools alike.
Extension and MCP tools that operate on paths (via `input.path`, MCP's `input.arguments.path`, or a registered access extractor) are gated by default, so a `path` deny cannot be overridden by a per-tool allow — making it the right place to protect sensitive files like `.env` or `~/.ssh/*` from every tool at once.
A `path` pattern matches both the path as the agent references it and its canonical (symlink-resolved) form, so a deny still fires when a symlink aliases a sensitive target.

For per-tool path patterns (`read`, `write`, `edit`, `find`, `grep`, `ls`), patterns are matched against the file path from `input.path`.
This lets you express rules like "allow reads but deny `.env` files" at the individual tool level.
Like the cross-cutting `path` surface, per-tool patterns match both the referenced path and its canonical (symlink-resolved) form, so a per-tool deny resists symlink-alias evasion.
When Pi's current working directory is known, relative path inputs also match their cwd-normalized absolute form, so `src/App.jsx` can match both `src/*` and `/workspace/project/*`.

The `external_directory` surface is the CWD-boundary gate: it decides whether reaching **outside** the working tree is allowed, and accepts a pattern map so you can allow specific outside-CWD directories without opening up all external access.
This is the right surface for silencing repeated prompts on a local cache like `~/.cargo/registry` — allow it here, not on `path`:

```jsonc
{
  "permission": {
    "external_directory": {
      "*": "ask",
      "~/.cargo/registry/*": "allow"
    }
  }
}
```

The trailing `*` is greedy and crosses subdirectory boundaries, so it allows every file beneath the directory; a bare `~/.cargo/registry` matches only the directory entry itself.

Four layers compose with most-restrictive-wins: `path` (cross-cutting) → `external_directory` (CWD boundary) → per-tool patterns → `bash` command patterns.
Because `ask` is more restrictive than `allow`, a `path` allow cannot loosen an `external_directory: ask` boundary — allow outside-CWD directories on `external_directory`.
See [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md) for the full recipe.

## Configuration

Config lives in one JSON file per scope:

| Scope   | Path                                                      |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Global  | `~/.pi/agent/extensions/pi-permission-system/config.json` |
| Project | `<cwd>/.pi/extensions/pi-permission-system/config.json`   |

Project overrides global; per-agent YAML frontmatter overrides both.

Within a surface map like `bash` or `mcp`, **last matching rule wins** — put broad catch-alls first and specific overrides after.

The optional `shellTools` field records which non-`bash` tools carry shell semantics (e.g. an `exec_command` tool that replaces native `bash`), so they are gated at full parity with native `bash` — see [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md#shelltools--gating-aliased-shell-tools).

For the full reference — all surfaces, runtime knobs, per-agent overrides, merge semantics, and common recipes — see [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md).

## Upgrading

### 16.0.0 — the bash gate now fails closed

The permission gate fails closed: an internal gate error blocks the tool (with a `gate_error` review-log entry) instead of running it ungated, and a non-empty bash command that cannot be parsed resolves to `ask` (sentinel `<unparseable-bash-command>`) rather than falling through to a permissive top-level `*`.
Commands that previously slipped through silently on the error or empty-parse path now block or prompt.

If you relied on the old permissive behavior for bash, set an explicit permissive bash policy — `"bash": { "*": "allow" }` — which also suppresses the new startup warning emitted when a top-level `"*": "allow"` leaves bash ungated.
